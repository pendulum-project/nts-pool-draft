                   NTS extensions for enabling pools
                         draft-nts-pool-latest

Abstract

   The aim of this document is to describe a proof of concept system for
   NTS pools that are able to be used by clients without any knowledge
   beyond plain NTS.  The work here focusses purely on creating an
   intermediate nts-ke server that can be configured with the addresses
   of multiple downstream servers and distribute load between them.  The
   parts of pool operation dealing with managing the list of servers are
   left out of scope for this work.

   NTS Record: Supported Algorithm List Critical bit: 1 Record Type
   Number: To be assigned by IANA (draft implementations: 0x4001)

   Client MUST send with no body.  Clients MAY use Keep Alive in
   combination with this record.

   Server MUST ignore any client body sent, and MUST send in response a
   Supported Algorithm List record with as data a list of tuples of two
   16 bit integers, the first giving a algorithm ID for the AEAD and the
   second giving the length of the key for that algorithm ID.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  New NTS records

   NTS Record: Keep Alive Critical bit: 0 Record Type Number: To be
   assigned by IANA (draft implementations: 0x4000)

   Client MUST send with no body.  Client MUST NOT use Keep Alive unless
   the request contains a record type allowing the use of Keep Alive.
   Within this specification, that is limited to the Supported Protocol
   List

   When supported by server, Server should include a Keep Alive record
   in the response and keep the TLS connection active after the response
   to handle further requests from the client.
